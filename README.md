# Object Tracking with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates real-time **object detection** using **TensorFlow.js** and the **COCO-SSD** model. The project captures the webcam feed, detects objects (such as hands, clocks, etc.), and displays them on the screen in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Track objects using TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD model.
- **Webcam Integration**: Uses your webcam to detect objects from a live feed.
- **Object List**: Dynamically displays detected objects with their confidence scores.
- **Mobile and Desktop Friendly**: Fully responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.
- **COCO-SSD Model**: A pre-trained object detection model capable of detecting 80 different object categories.
- **HTML5 & JavaScript**: For the frontend implementation.
